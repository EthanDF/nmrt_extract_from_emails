# nmrt_extract_from_emails

This script was created so that I could pull the repsonses from the web form submissions for an ALA program. The submissions are forwarded to a shared Yahoo inbox. Those emails are then forwarded to gmail so that they can be downloaded as an MBOX file. The mbox file doesn't seem to work with the MAILBOX python module so I converted it to a text file and mined the information out of it from there to a CSV file. 

Since the data submitted is about real paper, I've removed the results CSV and the input text file.

If you have a need for more information, you can always contact me.
